Step 19: Adding Elements to an Array

Question:
When an array holds values, or elements, those values are separated by commas.  

Example:
let array = ["first", "second"];

Task:
Change your `rows` declaration to be an array with the strings "Naomi", "Quincy", and "CamperChan".  
- The order of values in an array is important, so follow that order.  
- Remember that strings are case-sensitive.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = [];
rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Arrays store multiple values separated by commas.
- The order of elements matters: index 0 is the first element, index 1 is the second, etc.
- Strings in arrays are case-sensitive.
- This sets up a way to store multiple rows or levels for your pyramid generator.
