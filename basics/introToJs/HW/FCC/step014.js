Step 14: Clean Up Review Code

Question:
Now that you have reviewed declaration and initialization, clean up your code.  

Task:
- Remove the code you wrote for your review (profession and age variables).  
- Do **not** remove your `character` variable.
*/

// Solution:
let character = "Hello";

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Cleaning up review or test code helps keep your project organized.
- Only retain variables needed for future steps.
- This prepares a clean starting point for building more complex logic like loops and pyramids.
