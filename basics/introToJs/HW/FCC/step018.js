Step 18: Introduction to Arrays

Question:
In programming, you often need to work with lots of data. **Arrays** are one of the most basic data structures to organize and manage data.

- An array is a **non-primitive data type** that can hold a series of values.
- Primitive data types (like strings and numbers) can hold only one value at a time.
- Arrays can hold multiple values, including numbers, strings, or even other arrays.
- Arrays are denoted using **square brackets []**.

Example:
let array = [];

Task:
Declare a `rows` variable and assign it an empty array.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = [];

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Arrays are essential for storing multiple related values in a single variable.
- You can add, remove, or modify elements in an array.
- Arrays will be useful in the pyramid project to hold each row of the pyramid.
