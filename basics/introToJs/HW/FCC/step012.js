/*
Step 12: Clean Up Variables for Next Steps

Question:
You are now ready to declare your next variable.  
- Remove both `console.log` statements.  
- Remove the `character` reassignment.  
- Remove your `secondCharacter` variable.  
- Leave the `character` initialization unchanged.

Task:
Keep the `character` variable initialized and clean up the rest for the next steps.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';


/*
Notes / Learning:
- Cleaning up old code helps avoid confusion in future steps.
- Only keep variables that are needed for upcoming tasks.
- This sets a clean starting point for building the pyramid logic.
