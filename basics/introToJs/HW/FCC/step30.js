/*
Step 30: Resetting Values and Maintaining Consistency

Task:
1. Reassign your `rows` variable to an empty array `[]`.
2. Change your `'Hello'` string to use **double quotes** instead of single quotes.
3. Maintain consistency in your quotation style throughout the project.

// Solution:
let character = "Hello";
let count = 8;
let rows = [];

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Consistency in code style improves readability and maintainability.
- In JavaScript:
  → Strings can be written using single ('') or double ("") quotes.
  → There’s **no functional difference**, but consistent usage is a good practice.
- Resetting an array to `[]` clears its contents without deleting the variable.
- Example:
    let list = [1, 2, 3];
    list = []; // list is now empty
