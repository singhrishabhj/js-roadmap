Step 4: Strings in JavaScript

Question:
JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with **String** being one of them.  
A string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either **single (')** or **double (")** quotes.

Note:
- Strings are **immutable**, meaning once they are created, their content cannot be changed.
- The variable itself can be reassigned another value.

Task:
Change your "Hello" string to use **single quotes**.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Strings can be defined using single or double quotes, e.g., 'Hello' or "Hello".
- Immutability means you cannot change individual characters inside a string:
    let str = 'Hello';
    str[0] = 'h'; // does NOT work
- You can reassign a completely new string to the variable:
    character = 'Hi';
