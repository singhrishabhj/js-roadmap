Step 23: Clean Up Array Code

Question:
For now, clean up your code:  
- Remove your first console.log.  
- Remove the `rows[rows.length - 1]` assignment.  
- Leave the second `rows` log statement for later use.

Task:
Keep your array declaration and log the entire `rows` array.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
console.log(rows); // prints ['Naomi', 'Quincy', 'CamperChan']

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Cleaning up code helps focus on the upcoming steps.
- Keep only what is needed for the pyramid-building logic.
- Logging the array shows all elements at once.
