Step 5: Using console.log() in JavaScript

Question:
The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using `console.log()`.  

Example:
let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);

Explanation:
- The code above accesses the `developer` variable by its name in `console.log()`.
- The value inside the parentheses is what will be printed to the console.

Task:
Print the value of the `character` variable to the console. Then, click the "Console" button to view the output.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);

/*
Notes / Learning:
- `console.log()` is used for debugging and checking variable values.
- You can print variables, strings, numbers, and even expressions:
    console.log(5 + 10); // prints 15
    console.log('Hello ' + character); // prints concatenated string
- This is an essential tool for understanding how your code behaves.
