/*
Step 16: Performing Mathematical Operations

Question:
With the number data type, you can perform **mathematical operations**, like addition.

Task:
Print `count + 1` to the console.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
console.log(count + 1); // prints 9

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Numbers in JavaScript support arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %.
- `count + 1` adds 1 to the current value of count.
- Useful for loops, counters, and calculations in your pyramid generator.
