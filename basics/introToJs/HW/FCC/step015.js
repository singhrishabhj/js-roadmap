/*
Step 15: Declaring a Number Variable

Question:
Use `let` to declare a `count` variable. Assign it the number 8.  

Note:
- When using a number value, **do not use quotes**.

Example:
let money = 100;

Task:
Declare a `count` variable and assign it the number 8.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
let count;
count = 8;

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Numbers in JavaScript are primitive data types and are written without quotes.
- Declaring variables with meaningful names like `count` helps in loops or repeated actions.
- This sets the foundation for using the variable to control the pyramid height.
