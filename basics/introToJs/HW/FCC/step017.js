/*
Step 17: Using Other Mathematical Operators

Question:
You can also perform **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **division (/)**.  
Feel free to experiment with these operators and numbers in your `console.log`.  

Task:
When you are ready to move on, remove the `console.log` and keep the `count` variable.
*/

// Solution:
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;

/*
Notes / Learning:
- JavaScript supports basic arithmetic operations:
    - Addition: +
    - Subtraction: -
    - Multiplication: *
    - Division: /
- Useful for calculations in loops, pyramid generation, and other logic.
- Removing console logs helps clean up the code for the next steps.
