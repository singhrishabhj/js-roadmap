Step 1: Introduction to JavaScript and Pyramid Generator

Question:
JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike HTML and CSS, it is mainly used to write logic instead of markup.

In this project, you will learn the basics of JavaScript and apply those concepts to build a pyramid generator.

A pyramid generator is a program where you can:
- Set the type of character
- Set the count (height) of the pyramid
- Set the direction of the pyramid

The program should then generate a pyramid based on these inputs.
*/

// Solution:
console.log("Let's build a pyramid using JavaScript basics:");
console.log("    #    ");
console.log("   ###   ");
console.log("  #####  ");
console.log(" ####### ");
console.log("#########"); //added this

/*
Notes / Learning:
- This step introduces how to use console.log() to print output.
- You can create a simple visual pattern in the console before adding logic for dynamic input.
