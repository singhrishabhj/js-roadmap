/*
Step 3: Initializing Variables in JavaScript

Question:
Your `character` variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator `=`.  

Example:
let hello = "Hello";

Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as **initialization**.

Task:
Initialize your `character` variable by assigning it the value `"Hello"` during its declaration.
*/

// Solution:
let character = "Hello";

/*
Notes / Learning:
- Initialization is giving a variable a value when declaring it.
- Using `=` assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- You can later change the value by reassigning it, e.g., `character = "Hi"`.
- Always use descriptive variable names for readability.
